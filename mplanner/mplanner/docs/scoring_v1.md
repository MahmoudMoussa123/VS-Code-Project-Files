### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Android Studio**: Ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed on your machine.

2. **Install Flutter and Dart**: 
   - Follow the official Flutter installation guide: [Flutter Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
   - Ensure that the Flutter and Dart plugins are installed in Android Studio.

3. **Set Up Version Control**: 
   - Initialize a Git repository for your project.
   - Create a new repository on GitHub (or your preferred platform) and link it to your local repository.

### Step 2: Create a New Flutter Project

1. **Create a New Flutter Project**:
   - Open Android Studio.
   - Select "New Flutter Project".
   - Choose "Flutter Application" and click "Next".
   - Enter the project name as `mplanner`, set the project location, and ensure the Flutter SDK path is correct.
   - Click "Finish" to create the project.

2. **Project Structure**:
   - Organize your project structure according to the directory layout mentioned in the architecture document. Create folders for each feature module under `lib/`.

### Step 3: Initialize Project Dependencies

1. **Update `pubspec.yaml`**:
   - Add the necessary dependencies as outlined in the architecture and development plan. Hereâ€™s a sample of what to include:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_riverpod: ^1.0.0
     dio: ^4.0.0
     hive: ^2.0.0
     mobile_scanner: ^1.0.0
     freezed_annotation: ^1.0.0
     json_serializable: ^6.0.0
     flutter_secure_storage: ^5.0.0
     firebase_analytics: ^9.0.0
     sentry_flutter: ^6.0.0
   dev_dependencies:
     build_runner: ^2.0.0
     freezed: ^1.0.0
     json_serializable: ^6.0.0
   ```

2. **Run `flutter pub get`** to install the dependencies.

### Step 4: Set Up Project Structure

1. **Create Core Folders**:
   - Inside the `lib/` directory, create the following folders:
     - `app/`
     - `features/`
     - `models/`
     - `services/`
     - `repositories/`
     - `utils/`
     - `providers/`

2. **Create Feature Modules**:
   - Inside the `features/` folder, create subfolders for each feature module as mentioned in the architecture document (e.g., `feature_meal_discovery`, `feature_product_scan`, etc.).

### Step 5: Implement Initial Features

1. **Sprint 1: Foundation & Infrastructure**:
   - Follow the tasks outlined in Sprint 1 of the development plan:
     - Initialize the Flutter project with flavors (dev, staging, prod).
     - Set up Riverpod global providers and environment loader.
     - Configure CI/CD with GitHub Actions (create a `.github/workflows` directory and add your CI configuration).
     - Initialize Hive for local storage.

2. **Create Basic UI**:
   - Implement a simple UI in `lib/app/main.dart` to test the setup. For example, create a basic home screen with a button to navigate to the meal discovery feature.

### Step 6: Version Control and Documentation

1. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - Regularly commit your changes with meaningful messages.
   - Push your commits to the remote repository.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Create a `docs/` folder in the root of your project to store any additional documentation or notes you may need during development.

### Step 7: Follow the Development Plan

1. **Continue with the Development Plan**:
   - Move on to Sprint 2 and implement the authentication flow and core models as outlined in the development plan.
   - Ensure to follow the acceptance criteria for each task and maintain high test coverage.

### Step 8: Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Implement Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for your services and repositories as you develop them.
   - Use the testing strategies outlined in the architecture document.

2. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on each push.

### Step 9: Regular Reviews and Adjustments

1. **Review Progress**:
   - Regularly review your progress against the development plan and adjust your tasks as necessary.
   - Hold sprint reviews to assess completed work and plan for the next sprint.

By following these steps, you will be able to kick off the development of the "mplanner" project effectively. Make sure to refer back to the attached documentation for detailed specifications and guidelines as you progress through the development phases.
