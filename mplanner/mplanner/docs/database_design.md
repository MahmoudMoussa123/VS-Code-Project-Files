4. **Create a New Flutter Project**:
   - Open Android Studio and select `New Flutter Project`.
   - Choose `Flutter Application` and click `Next`.
   - Set the project name to `mplanner`, choose a suitable location, and ensure the Flutter SDK path is correct.
   - Click `Finish` to create the project.

### Step 2: Project Structure and Dependencies

1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Create the directory structure as outlined in the architecture document. For example:
     ```
     lib/
       app/
       features/
         feature_meal_discovery/
         feature_meal_plan_builder/
         feature_recipe_details/
         feature_nutrition_tracking/
         feature_product_scan/
         feature_health_scoring/
         feature_alternatives/
         feature_shopping_list/
         feature_auth/
         feature_user_profile/
         feature_preferences/
         feature_retail_integration/
         feature_crowdsourcing/
         feature_admin_tools/
         feature_notifications/
         feature_search/
         feature_offline_cache/
       main.dart
     ```

2. **Add Dependencies**:
   - Open `pubspec.yaml` and add the necessary dependencies as per the development plan:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       flutter:
         sdk: flutter
       riverpod: ^x.x.x
       dio: ^x.x.x
       freezed_annotation: ^x.x.x
       json_serializable: ^x.x.x
       hive: ^x.x.x
       hive_flutter: ^x.x.x
       mobile_scanner: ^x.x.x
       flutter_secure_storage: ^x.x.x
       firebase_analytics: ^x.x.x
       sentry_flutter: ^x.x.x
     ```

   - Run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies.

### Step 3: Implement Initial Features

1. **Sprint 1: Foundation & Infrastructure**:
   - Create the initial Flutter project structure and set up the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions as described in the development plan.
   - Implement the `app` folder with the necessary files for app initialization, including `app_bootstrap.dart`.

2. **Set Up Riverpod**:
   - Create a global provider for environment configuration in `lib/app/environment.dart`.
   - Set up logging and exception handling classes as per the development plan.

3. **Initialize Hive**:
   - Create a Hive initialization function in `lib/app/hive_init.dart` to set up the local database.

### Step 4: Implement Authentication and Core Models

1. **Sprint 2: Auth & Core Models**:
   - Implement the authentication flow with a mock service.
   - Create domain models for `Product`, `Nutrition`, `Score`, and `Meal` using Freezed and JSON serialization.

2. **Set Up User Preferences**:
   - Create a user preferences model and repository to manage dietary tags and other user settings.

### Step 5: Product Scanning and Health Scoring MVP

1. **Sprint 3: Product Scan & Health Score MVP**:
   - Implement the barcode scanning feature using the `mobile_scanner` package.
   - Create a `ProductApi` to fetch product data and a `ScoringService` to calculate health scores.

### Step 6: Meal Discovery and Recipe Integration

1. **Sprint 4: Meal Discovery & Recipe Integration**:
   - Implement the meal discovery feature, allowing users to browse meals and view details.
   - Create a repository for meals and integrate it with the UI.

### Step 7: Meal Planning and Shopping List

1. **Sprint 5: Meal Plan Builder, Shopping List, Alternatives Engine**:
   - Implement the meal planning feature, allowing users to create and manage meal plans.
   - Create a shopping list generation feature based on the meal plan.

### Step 8: Nutrition Tracking and Transparency

1. **Sprint 6: Nutrition Tracking & Transparency**:
   - Implement the nutrition tracking feature, allowing users to log meals and view daily summaries.
   - Create a methodology screen to explain how scores are calculated.

### Step 9: Crowdsourcing and Release Preparation

1. **Sprint 7: Crowdsourcing, Hardening & Release Prep**:
   - Implement basic crowdsourcing features for user edits and moderation.
   - Conduct performance profiling and prepare for release.

### Step 10: Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Implement Unit and Widget Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for services and repositories.
   - Create widget tests for key UI components.

2. **Set Up Continuous Integration**:
   - Configure GitHub Actions to run tests and build the application on each push.

### Step 11: Documentation and Finalization

1. **Document the Code**:
   - Ensure that all code is well-documented, and update the README file with setup instructions.

2. **Prepare for Deployment**:
   - Follow the release checklist to ensure all criteria are met before deploying the application.

### Step 12: Next Actions

1. **Execute Sprint 1 Tasks**: Start with the tasks outlined in Sprint 1 of the development plan.
2. **Draft Documentation**: Prepare any necessary documentation for the project.
3. **Prepare Mock Data**: Create mock JSON fixtures for products and meals as needed.

By following these steps, you can effectively kick off the development of the "mplanner" project in Android Studio, adhering to the provided development plan and documentation.
