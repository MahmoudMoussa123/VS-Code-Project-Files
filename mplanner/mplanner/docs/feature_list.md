### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Android Studio**: Ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed on your machine.
2. **Install Flutter**: Follow the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up Flutter on your machine.
3. **Install Dart**: Dart comes bundled with Flutter, but ensure you have the Dart SDK installed as well.
4. **Set Up Flutter Plugin**: In Android Studio, go to `Preferences` > `Plugins` and search for the Flutter plugin to install it.

### Step 2: Create a New Flutter Project

1. **Open Android Studio**.
2. **Create a New Flutter Project**:
   - Select `File` > `New` > `New Flutter Project`.
   - Choose `Flutter Application`.
   - Set the project name to `mplanner`.
   - Choose a suitable location for your project.
   - Ensure the Flutter SDK path is set correctly.
   - Click `Finish`.

### Step 3: Project Structure

1. **Directory Layout**: Organize your project according to the directory layout specified in the architecture document. Create folders for each feature module:
   ```
   lib/
     app/
     feature_meal_discovery/
     feature_meal_plan_builder/
     feature_recipe_details/
     feature_nutrition_tracking/
     feature_product_scan/
     feature_health_scoring/
     feature_alternatives/
     feature_shopping_list/
     feature_auth/
     feature_user_profile/
     feature_preferences/
     feature_retail_integration/
     feature_crowdsourcing/
     feature_admin_tools/
     feature_notifications/
     feature_search/
     feature_offline_cache/
   ```

### Step 4: Initialize Dependencies

1. **Add Dependencies**: Open `pubspec.yaml` and add the necessary dependencies as outlined in the development plan:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_riverpod: ^x.x.x
     dio: ^x.x.x
     hive: ^x.x.x
     hive_flutter: ^x.x.x
     mobile_scanner: ^x.x.x
     freezed_annotation: ^x.x.x
     json_serializable: ^x.x.x
     flutter_secure_storage: ^x.x.x
     firebase_analytics: ^x.x.x
     sentry_flutter: ^x.x.x
   ```

2. **Run `flutter pub get`** to install the dependencies.

### Step 5: Set Up Project Structure and Code Generation

1. **Code Generation**: Set up code generation for `freezed` and `json_serializable`:
   - Add the following to your `dev_dependencies` in `pubspec.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     dev_dependencies:
       build_runner: ^x.x.x
       freezed: ^x.x.x
       json_serializable: ^x.x.x
     ```

2. **Create Models**: Start creating your domain models using `freezed` and `json_serializable`. For example, create a `product.dart` file in the `models` directory:
   ```dart
   import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

   part 'product.freezed.dart';
   part 'product.g.dart';

   @freezed
   class Product with _$Product {
     const factory Product({
       required String id,
       required String name,
       required String gtin,
       // Add other fields as necessary
     }) = _Product;

     factory Product.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$ProductFromJson(json);
   }
   ```

3. **Run Code Generation**: Execute the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

### Step 6: Implement Core Features

1. **Sprint 1: Foundation & Infrastructure**:
   - Initialize the Flutter project with flavors (dev, staging, prod).
   - Set up Riverpod for state management.
   - Implement CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions as per the development plan.

2. **Sprint 2: Auth & Core Models**:
   - Implement the authentication flow (email/password).
   - Create domain models for Product, Nutrition, Score, and Meal.

3. **Sprint 3: Product Scan & Health Score MVP**:
   - Implement the barcode scanning feature using `mobile_scanner`.
   - Integrate the Product API and implement the scoring service.

4. **Continue with subsequent sprints** as outlined in the development plan, ensuring to follow the acceptance criteria and deliverables for each sprint.

### Step 7: Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Implement Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for your services and repositories to ensure code quality.
2. **Run Tests**: Use the command:
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

### Step 8: Version Control

1. **Initialize Git**: If not already done, initialize a Git repository for version control.
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. **Create a `.gitignore`** file to exclude unnecessary files and directories.
3. **Commit Changes**: Regularly commit your changes with meaningful messages.

### Step 9: Documentation

1. **Maintain Documentation**: Keep your documentation updated as you progress through the development phases. This includes updating the README, API contracts, and any architectural decisions.

### Step 10: Deployment

1. **Prepare for Deployment**: Follow the deployment guidelines in the architecture document to prepare your app for release.

By following these steps, you will be able to kickstart the development of the "mplanner" project effectively, adhering to the provided development plan and documentation.
