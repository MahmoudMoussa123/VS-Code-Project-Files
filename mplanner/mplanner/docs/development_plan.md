### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Android Studio**: Ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed on your machine.

2. **Install Flutter and Dart**: 
   - Follow the official Flutter installation guide: [Flutter Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
   - Ensure that the Flutter and Dart plugins are installed in Android Studio.

3. **Set Up Version Control**: 
   - Initialize a Git repository for your project.
   - Create a remote repository on GitHub or another platform to push your code.

### Step 2: Create a New Flutter Project

1. **Open Android Studio**.
2. **Create a New Flutter Project**:
   - Select "New Flutter Project".
   - Choose "Flutter Application".
   - Set the project name to `mplanner`.
   - Choose a suitable location for your project.
   - Ensure the Flutter SDK path is set correctly.
   - Click "Finish".

### Step 3: Project Structure and Dependencies

1. **Directory Structure**: 
   - Organize your project according to the directory layout mentioned in the architecture document. Create folders for each feature module under `lib/`:
     ```
     lib/
       app/
       feature_meal_discovery/
       feature_meal_plan_builder/
       feature_recipe_details/
       feature_nutrition_tracking/
       feature_product_scan/
       feature_health_scoring/
       feature_alternatives/
       feature_shopping_list/
       feature_auth/
       feature_user_profile/
       feature_preferences/
       feature_retail_integration/
       feature_crowdsourcing/
       feature_admin_tools/
       feature_notifications/
       feature_search/
       feature_offline_cache/
       main.dart
     ```

2. **Add Dependencies**: 
   - Open `pubspec.yaml` and add the necessary dependencies as per the tech stack outlined in the architecture document. Hereâ€™s a sample of what to include:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       flutter:
         sdk: flutter
       flutter_riverpod: ^x.x.x
       dio: ^x.x.x
       hive: ^x.x.x
       hive_flutter: ^x.x.x
       freezed_annotation: ^x.x.x
       json_serializable: ^x.x.x
       mobile_scanner: ^x.x.x
       flutter_secure_storage: ^x.x.x
       firebase_analytics: ^x.x.x
       sentry_flutter: ^x.x.x
     dev_dependencies:
       build_runner: ^x.x.x
       freezed: ^x.x.x
       json_serializable: ^x.x.x
       flutter_test:
         sdk: flutter
     ```

3. **Run `flutter pub get`** to install the dependencies.

### Step 4: Implement Initial Features

1. **Sprint 1: Foundation & Infrastructure**:
   - **Project Bootstrap**: Set up the basic structure and configurations as outlined in Sprint 1 of the development plan.
   - **CI Setup**: Create GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD as per the guidelines.
   - **Riverpod Setup**: Initialize Riverpod providers for global state management.
   - **Hive Initialization**: Set up Hive for local storage, including secure key storage.

2. **Create Basic UI**:
   - Implement a simple UI in `main.dart` to test the setup.
   - Create a basic navigation structure to switch between different feature modules.

### Step 5: Implement Authentication and Core Models

1. **Sprint 2: Auth & Core Models**:
   - Implement the authentication flow (email/password).
   - Create domain models for `Product`, `Nutrition`, `Score`, and `Meal` using Freezed.
   - Set up secure token storage.

### Step 6: Continue Development

1. **Follow the Development Plan**: Continue implementing features as per the development plan, focusing on one sprint at a time.
2. **Testing**: Write unit tests for each feature as you develop them to ensure high test coverage.
3. **Documentation**: Keep your code well-documented and maintain a changelog for your project.

### Step 7: Version Control

1. **Commit Regularly**: Make regular commits to your Git repository, following best practices for commit messages.
2. **Push to Remote**: Push your changes to the remote repository frequently to keep your work backed up.

### Step 8: Review and Iterate

1. **Code Reviews**: If working in a team, conduct code reviews to maintain code quality.
2. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Be open to feedback and iterate on your implementation as needed.

### Step 9: Prepare for Release

1. **Final Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of the application.
2. **Release Checklist**: Follow the release checklist provided in the development plan to ensure everything is ready for deployment.

By following these steps, you will be able to kickstart the development of the "mplanner" project effectively. Good luck!
