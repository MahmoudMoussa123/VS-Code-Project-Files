### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Android Studio**: Ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed on your machine.
2. **Install Flutter**: Follow the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up Flutter on your machine.
3. **Set Up Dart**: Dart comes bundled with Flutter, so installing Flutter will also install Dart.

### Step 2: Create a New Flutter Project

1. **Open Android Studio**.
2. **Create a New Flutter Project**:
   - Select "New Flutter Project".
   - Choose "Flutter Application".
   - Set the project name to `mplanner`.
   - Choose a suitable location for your project.
   - Ensure the Flutter SDK path is set correctly.
   - Click "Finish".

### Step 3: Project Structure

1. **Organize the Project Structure**:
   - Create the following directories under `lib/`:
     ```
     lib/
       app/
       features/
         feature_meal_discovery/
         feature_meal_plan_builder/
         feature_recipe_details/
         feature_nutrition_tracking/
         feature_product_scan/
         feature_health_scoring/
         feature_alternatives/
         feature_shopping_list/
         feature_auth/
         feature_user_profile/
         feature_preferences/
         feature_retail_integration/
         feature_crowdsourcing/
         feature_admin_tools/
         feature_notifications/
         feature_search/
         feature_offline_cache/
       models/
       services/
       repositories/
       utils/
       main.dart
     ```

### Step 4: Add Dependencies

1. **Open `pubspec.yaml`** and add the necessary dependencies based on the tech stack outlined in the architecture document. Hereâ€™s a sample of what to include:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_riverpod: ^1.0.0
     dio: ^4.0.0
     hive: ^2.0.0
     hive_flutter: ^1.0.0
     freezed_annotation: ^1.0.0
     json_serializable: ^6.0.0
     mobile_scanner: ^0.0.1
     flutter_secure_storage: ^5.0.0
     firebase_analytics: ^9.0.0
     sentry_flutter: ^6.0.0
   dev_dependencies:
     build_runner: ^2.0.0
     freezed: ^1.0.0
     json_serializable: ^6.0.0
     flutter_test:
       sdk: flutter
   ```

2. **Run `flutter pub get`** to install the dependencies.

### Step 5: Set Up Code Generation

1. **Create a `build.yaml`** file in the root of your project to configure code generation.
2. **Set up the `freezed` and `json_serializable`** configurations in your `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   build_runner:
     build:
       outputs:
         lib/models/*.g.dart:
           - build_runner
   ```

### Step 6: Initialize Hive

1. **Create a Hive initialization file** in `lib/app/hive_init.dart`:
   ```dart
   import 'package:hive/hive.dart';
   import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';

   Future<void> initHive() async {
     final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
     Hive.init(directory.path);
     // Register adapters here if needed
   }
   ```

2. **Call `initHive()` in your `main.dart`**:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'app/hive_init.dart';

   void main() async {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     await initHive();
     runApp(MyApp());
   }

   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         title: 'MPlanner',
         theme: ThemeData(
           primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
         ),
         home: HomeScreen(),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 7: Implement Core Features

1. **Start with Sprint 1**: Implement the foundation and infrastructure as outlined in the development plan.
   - Set up the project structure.
   - Implement CI/CD configurations (if applicable).
   - Create the initial UI components and navigation.

2. **Follow the Sprint Breakdown**: Move through each sprint, implementing the deliverables and tasks as specified in the development plan.

### Step 8: Version Control

1. **Initialize Git**: Run `git init` in your project directory.
2. **Create a `.gitignore` file** to exclude unnecessary files:
   ```
   .idea/
   .dart_tool/
   build/
   pubspec.lock
   ```
3. **Commit your changes** regularly as you progress through the development.

### Step 9: Testing

1. **Set up testing** as per the testing plan outlined in the documentation.
2. **Write unit tests** for your services and repositories.

### Step 10: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

1. **Set up GitHub Actions** or another CI/CD tool to automate testing and deployment as per the CI/CD section of the architecture document.

### Step 11: Documentation

1. **Document your code** and maintain a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the project.

### Step 12: Regular Updates

1. **Regularly update your dependencies** and keep track of any changes in the architecture or development plan.

By following these steps, you will be able to kickstart the development of the "mplanner" project effectively. Make sure to refer back to the attached documents for detailed specifications and guidelines as you progress through each phase of development.
