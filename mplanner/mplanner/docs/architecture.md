### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Android Studio**: Ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed on your machine.

2. **Install Flutter and Dart**: If you haven't already, install Flutter and Dart SDKs. You can follow the official [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

3. **Set Up Flutter in Android Studio**:
   - Open Android Studio.
   - Go to `File > Settings > Plugins`.
   - Search for "Flutter" and install it. This will also install the Dart plugin.

4. **Create a New Flutter Project**:
   - Open Android Studio and select `File > New > New Flutter Project`.
   - Choose `Flutter Application` and click `Next`.
   - Enter the project name as `mplanner`.
   - Set the Flutter SDK path if prompted.
   - Choose a suitable project location and click `Finish`.

### Step 2: Project Structure and Dependencies

1. **Directory Structure**: Organize your project according to the directory layout mentioned in the architecture document. Create folders for each feature module under `lib/`:
   ```
   lib/
     app/
     feature_meal_discovery/
     feature_meal_plan_builder/
     feature_recipe_details/
     feature_nutrition_tracking/
     feature_product_scan/
     feature_health_scoring/
     feature_alternatives/
     feature_shopping_list/
     feature_auth/
     feature_user_profile/
     feature_preferences/
     feature_retail_integration/
     feature_crowdsourcing/
     feature_admin_tools/
     feature_notifications/
     feature_search/
     feature_offline_cache/
   ```

2. **Add Dependencies**: Open `pubspec.yaml` and add the necessary dependencies as outlined in the development plan:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     hooks_riverpod: ^x.x.x
     dio: ^x.x.x
     freezed_annotation: ^x.x.x
     json_serializable: ^x.x.x
     hive: ^x.x.x
     hive_flutter: ^x.x.x
     mobile_scanner: ^x.x.x
     flutter_secure_storage: ^x.x.x
     firebase_analytics: ^x.x.x
     sentry_flutter: ^x.x.x
   dev_dependencies:
     build_runner: ^x.x.x
     freezed: ^x.x.x
     json_serializable: ^x.x.x
     flutter_test:
       sdk: flutter
   ```

3. **Run `flutter pub get`** to install the dependencies.

### Step 3: Implement Initial Features

1. **Sprint 1: Foundation & Infrastructure**:
   - Create the initial Flutter project structure.
   - Set up Riverpod for state management.
   - Initialize Hive for local storage.
   - Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions (create a `.github/workflows` directory and add your CI configuration).

2. **Create Core Folders**: Inside the `lib/` directory, create folders for `models`, `repositories`, `services`, and `utils` as per the architecture document.

3. **Implement Environment Configuration**:
   - Create an `environment.dart` file to manage API base URLs and other environment-specific configurations.

4. **Set Up Logging and Error Handling**:
   - Create a base exception class (`AppException`) and implement logging using Sentry.

### Step 4: Start Development of Features

1. **Sprint 2: Auth & Core Models**:
   - Implement the authentication flow (create mock endpoints).
   - Define domain models using Freezed for `Product`, `Nutrition`, `Score`, and `Meal`.
   - Create a basic login screen and navigation.

2. **Sprint 3: Product Scan & Health Score MVP**:
   - Implement the barcode scanning feature using `mobile_scanner`.
   - Create a `ProductApi` to fetch product data.
   - Implement the scoring service with a basic deterministic algorithm.

3. **Continue with Subsequent Sprints**:
   - Follow the development plan to implement features for meal discovery, meal planning, nutrition tracking, and more as outlined in the sprints.

### Step 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Write Unit Tests**: Ensure that you write unit tests for your services and repositories as you develop features.

2. **Set Up CI/CD**: Configure GitHub Actions to run tests and build the application automatically.

### Step 6: Documentation and Version Control

1. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control. Initialize a Git repository in your project directory and commit your changes regularly.

2. **Documentation**: Maintain documentation for your code, including comments and README files for each feature module.

### Step 7: Regular Reviews and Iterations

1. **Conduct Regular Code Reviews**: Collaborate with your team to review code and ensure adherence to best practices.

2. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Use feedback from testing and reviews to improve the application continuously.

By following these steps, you will be able to kickstart the development of the "mplanner" project effectively. Make sure to refer to the attached documentation for detailed specifications and guidelines throughout the development process.
